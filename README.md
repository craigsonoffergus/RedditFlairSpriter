**Installation**
----
You need Python and pip installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements


**Running The Script**
----
`cd` into the directory of the `generatesprites.py` script. Make sure all the images you want are in the `inputs` directory, and that they are all named in the pattern "layer-%%%NAME.png". Then just run `python generatesprites.py`. All the output CSS and sprites will be in the `output` directory.
